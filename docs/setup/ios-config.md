## How to configure the iOS application

To get a better understanding of this template's setup and learn how to configure the basic properties of your iOS app without Xcode,
open the `iosApp/Configuration/Config.xcconfig` file in Android Studio. The configuration file contains:

* `APP_NAME`, a target executable and an application bundle name.
* `BUNDLE_ID`, which [uniquely identifies the app throughout the system][bundleID].
* `TEAM_ID`, [a unique identifier generated by Apple that's assigned to your team][teamID].

[bundleID]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundleidentifier#discussion
[teamID]: https://developer.apple.com/help/account/manage-your-team/locate-your-team-id/#:~:text=A%20Team%20ID%20is%20a,developer%20in%20App%20Store%20Connect

To configure the `APP_NAME` option, open `Config.xcconfig` in any text editor *before opening* the project in Android Studio, and then set
the desired name.

If you need to change this option after you open the project in Android Studio, do the following:

1. Close the project in Android Studio.
2. Run `./cleanup.sh` in your terminal.
3. Change the setting.
4. Open the project in Android Studio again.

To configure advanced settings, use Xcode. After opening the project in Android Studio,
open the `iosApp/iosApp.xcworkspace` file in Xcode and make changes there.
