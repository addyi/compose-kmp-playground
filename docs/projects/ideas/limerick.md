# Project Draft: Limerick Generator with ChatGPT

## Project Description

In this project, an application will be developed to generate limericks about specific topics using OpenAI's ChatGPT. This idea is inspired
by the Wochend√§mmerung podcast, available [here](https://wochendaemmerung.de).

## Key Features and Learnings

The application will:

- Integrate with the ChatGPT API: This involves setting up and sending requests to the ChatGPT API.
- Generate limericks: The application should be able to craft limericks based on topics provided by the user.

The main learning opportunity from this project encompasses:

- Gaining hands-on experience with the ChatGPT API.

Upon completing this project, practical understanding of how to interact with an AI model API, specifically the ChatGPT API, and leveraging
AI for creative content generation will be obtained.
