# Project Draft: GPS Speedometer App

## Project Description

The idea for this project is to create an application that utilizes GPS to show the current speed, distance traveled since the start of
measurement, and maximum speed attained. The idea is inspired by this [Youtube video](https://youtube.com/shorts/rctfgMmnyWo?si=-5iXUthtW).

## Key Features and Learnings

The application will need to:

- Access GPS data: Use native Android and iOS APIs to get GPS data.
- Calculate and display current speed: Based on the GPS data, calculate and show the user's current speed.
- Measure distance: Keep track of the distance traveled since the start of the measurement.
- Record maximum speed: Track the maximum speed that the user has reached.
