# Dependency Management

Dependency Management is a crucial part of any software project. It is important to keep track of the dependencies used in a project and to
ensure that they are up to date. This project uses Gradle to manage dependencies.

To make life easier, this project uses [dependency locking](dependency-locking.md) and [gradle version catalog](version-catalog.md) to help
manage dependencies and keep them up to date.
