# Welcome to my Compose Kotlin Multiplatform Playground! :simple-jetpackcompose:

!!! tip "Pushing knowledge boundaries, one line of code at a time."

This project is my playground playground for experimenting with new technologies, frameworks, and libraries. It's a space to learn, grow,
and push knowledge boundaries, one line of code at a time.

The playground is built on the [JetBrains Compose Multiplatform Mobile template][template].

Check out the website for more insights into the project:

- [Project Setup & Getting Started](setup/setup.md)

- [Project Tooling and Resources](tooling/index.md)

In the pipeline are some exciting [project ideas](projects/index.md) like the APOD App, a Habit Tracker, a Limerick Generator with ChatGPT,
and a Pok√©dex App, along
with an exploration of libraries and tools such as Ktor, Koin, SQLDelight, Coil, and Voyager for Compose Navigation.

Join in the journey to learn more and push the boundaries of what's possible. Suggestions and project ideas are always welcome!

Let's code, learn, and have fun!

Happy Hacking!
