# Welcome to my Compose Kotlin Multiplatform Playground!

> Pushing knowledge boundaries, one line of code at a time.

Welcome to my playground. This is a space where I test the waters of new technologies like Compose Kotlin Multiplatform, dive
into the world of Gradle including dependency locking and version catalogs, lint with detekt & ktlint, and even create documentation with
MkDocs. Consider it my sandbox for pushing knowledge boundaries, one line of code at a time.

Check out the project's **documentation website** [here](https://addyi.github.io/compose-kmp-playground/).

This project is based on the *official JetBrains Compose Multiplatform Mobile template*, which you can
find [here](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-ios-android-template).

## Features

- Editorconfig file
- CI with GitHub Actions
- Documentation Website with MkDocs Material
- Gradle dependency locking
- Gradle version catalog
- WIP: Linting with detekt and ktlint

## Future Endeavours

The plan is to explore more libraries and tools, such as Ktor, Koin, SQLDelight, Coil, Compose Navigation with Voyager, and anything else
that piques my interest.

I'm all set to start on a few exciting projects:

- Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) App
- Habit Tracker App
- Limerick Generator with ChatGPT
- Pok√©dex App

If you have any cool project ideas or suggestions, feel free to share them!

Happy Hacking!
